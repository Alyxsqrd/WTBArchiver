# World to Build Archival Tools

World to Build has officially ceased operations and shut down its website as of May 20th, 2024. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240130014644/https://blog.worldtobuild.com/2024/01/the-end-of-the-road/)

As the website has shut down and the APIs and web scraping URLs have gone offline, these tools are no longer usable.

Alyx originally started these tools, then later expanded by StarManTheGamer to archive all information on World to Build into one database.

Using these tools, an archive will become available online with all of the information previously available on World to Build so that others can revisit their creations, and also expand the word as to what World to Build used to be, and what a vibrant community it was.

These tools can archive everything offered on the website, except:

Club shouts/walls and user's friends and inventories

**RIP World to Build. 2018 - 2024**
