# World to Build Archival Tools

World to Build has officially ceased operations and shut down their website as of May 20th, 2024. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240130014644/https://blog.worldtobuild.com/2024/01/the-end-of-the-road/)

As the website has shutdown and the APIs and web scraping URLs have gone offline, these tools are no longer usable.

These tools was originally started by Alyx, and then later expanded by StarManTheGamer in an attempt to archive all information on World to Build into one database.

Using these tools, an archive will become available online with all of the information that was previously available on World to Build so that others can revisit their creations, and also expand the word as to what World to Build used to be, and what a vibrant community it was.

These tools are able to archive everything offered on the website, except:

Club shouts/walls
User's friends and inventories

**RIP World to Build. 2018 - 2024**
